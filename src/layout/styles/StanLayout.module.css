Unusual to base "mobile first" media queries of the height rather than width, but given the target devices being TVs which are typically
of fixed and known dimensions, this way just make reading the code easier. While we could use the width, EG: 1280px for a 720p screen,
using the height in this manner just makes it slighly easier for the developer to instantly know which is which at first glance.
